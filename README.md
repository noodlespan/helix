=====================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ProjectHelixCoin/helix.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ProjectHelixCoin/helix) [![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/projecthelixcoin%2Fhelix.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/gh/projecthelixcoin%2Fhelix)

Helix is a cutting edge cryptocurrency, with many features not available in most other cryptocurrencies.
- Anonymized transactions using zerocoin technology
- 100% Proof of Stake 3.0 Consensus protocol, allowing very low transaction fees and energy expenditure, and staking rewards to all participants in the network
- Masternode technology used to secure the network and provide the above features, each Masternode is secured
  with collateral of 10K HLIX
- Decentralized blockchain voting utilizing Masternode technology to form a DAO. The blockchain will distribute monthly treasury funds based on successful proposals submitted by the community and voted on by the DAO.

Since then, the Helix repository has been rebaselined to show the fork relationship properly.
